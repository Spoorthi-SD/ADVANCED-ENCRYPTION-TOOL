# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based tool designed to provide secure encryption and decryption of files using advanced encryption algorithms. The tool supports various encryption algorithms, including AES-256, and provides a user-friendly interface for easy encryption and decryption.

Tools and Software Used

Python 3.x (Programming Language)
VSCode (Integrated Development Environment)
PyCrypto Library (for encryption and decryption)
Hashlib Library (for hashing and data integrity)
Editor Platform

The entire project was developed using VSCode, a popular open-source code editor. VSCode provides an excellent environment for writing, debugging, and testing Python code.

Applicability

The Advanced Encryption Tool can be applied in various scenarios, including:

Secure Data Storage: Encrypt sensitive data for secure storage.
Secure Data Transfer: Encrypt data for secure transfer over the internet.
Compliance with Regulations: Use the tool to comply with regulations requiring secure data storage and transfer.
Encryption Algorithms

The tool supports the following encryption algorithms:

AES-256: A widely used and highly secure encryption algorithm.
RSA: A public-key encryption algorithm commonly used for secure data transfer.
Code Explanation

The code is organized into separate modules, each with its own specific function and task. The modules are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive encryption and decryption solution.
